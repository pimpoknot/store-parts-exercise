## How to install and run the application

I install concurrently to run the both folder in the same terminal. But you can run in separate folder.

`Using concurrently`
```
npm install
npm run dev
```


`Separate folder`

```
yarn
yarn start

or

npm install
npm start
```

yarn start

or

npm install
npm start
